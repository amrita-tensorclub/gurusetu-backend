# Guru Setu

## Abstract
Guru Setu is an intelligent web platform that bridges the gap between students and faculty in engineering colleges by leveraging machine learning-powered recommendations. The platform solves two critical problems: discovering cross-departmental research opportunities and locating faculty cabins on campus. Students receive personalized faculty recommendations based on matching interests and skills, while faculty get curated student suggestions for their research openings. The system eliminates information asymmetry, reduces time waste, and fosters meaningful academic collaborations beyond departmental boundaries.

## Problem Statement

### Discovery Gap
Students struggle to find research and project opportunities aligned with their interests, especially across departments. Faculty find it equally challenging to identify genuinely interested and capable students for their research work.

### Information Asymmetry
Current systems rely on informal networks, notice boards, and department-specific announcements, leading to missed collaboration opportunities and inefficient talent matching.

### Navigation Frustration
Students waste significant time wandering campus asking "Where is Prof. X's cabin?" even when they know whom to meet, creating a barrier to faculty-student interactions.

## Solution

Guru Setu provides an ML-driven recommendation engine that matches students with faculty based on:

*   Areas of interest and domain expertise
*   Previous projects, research papers, and publications
*   Current research and project openings
*   Technical skills and technology stack overlap

Additionally, the platform includes digital cabin navigation, displaying exact faculty locations (block, floor, cabin number) to eliminate search time and make campus visits effortless.
